    question: 'Is it mandatory to show a flight reservation for a Schengen visa application?',
    answer:
      'Yes, most Schengen embassies and visa centers require a confirmed or reserved return flight itinerary as proof of onward and return travel when applying for a Schengen visa. A flight reservation helps visa officers assess your travel plan without requiring you to purchase a non-refundable ticket.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Will a dummy ticket work for a Schengen visa?',
    answer:
      'Yes. A dummy ticket for a Schengen visa is widely accepted when it is a genuine flight reservation with a verifiable PNR code. Embassies and visa centers such as VFS and BLS accept these reservations as valid proof of travel for visa applications.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need to buy an actual flight ticket for a Schengen visa?',
    answer:
      'No, you do not need to buy a real flight ticket before your visa is approved. A dummy flight ticket or flight reservation allows you to submit embassy-ready travel proof while avoiding the financial risk of purchasing a non-refundable airfare.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How long is your dummy ticket valid for a Schengen visa?',
    answer:
      'Our dummy tickets for Schengen visa applications are available with flexible validity options of 48 hours, 7 days, or 14 days. This allows you to choose a validity period that matches your visa appointment and document submission timeline.',
  },
  {
    question: 'When should I order a dummy ticket for my Schengen visa appointment?',
    answer:
      'It is recommended to order your dummy ticket one to three days before your Schengen visa appointment so the reservation remains active during verification. For urgent or last-minute appointments, same-day express delivery is also available.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you offer refunds if my Schengen visa is rejected?',
    answer:
      'As dummy tickets are a document-preparation service, refunds are not offered after delivery. However, if any correction or update is required due to an error on our side, we will revise the reservation at no additional cost.',
